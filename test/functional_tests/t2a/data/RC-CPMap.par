# Ring Closures CompatibilityMatrix for Class Based Builders
# 
# NOTE-1: this matric is symmetric. So if you white RCN X:0 Y:0, the
#         symmetric entry RCN Y:0 X:0 is assumed as well.
#
# NOTE-2: the RC-CPMap considers the APClasses of the AP hosting 
#         a ring closing attractor (RCA), not the APClass of the 
#         RCA itself.
#
# NOTE-3: it is assumed that APClass-to-bond order relation is properly
#         given in the regular compatibility matrix for all the APclasses
#         reported here
