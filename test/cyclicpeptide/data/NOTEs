These are things to be aware of:

* Modify the template's contract by hand in the lib_scaff.sdf file.
  fromn FIXED to FREE to allow modifications within the template.
  This change can not yet be performed in the GUI.

* Modify the type of building block ('buildingBlockType') of the empty
  vertices that compose the template, and make it be 'FRAGMENT'. This 
  to enable the identification of the suitable type of candidate 
  building blocks to use in mutation of those vertices.
  This change can not yet be performed in the GUI.
