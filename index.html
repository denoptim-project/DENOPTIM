About DENOPTIM</h1>
<p >DENOPTIM is an open source software suite for the <em>de novo</em> design of chemical entities. The name <em>DENOPTIM</em> stands for '<em>De novo</em> Optimization of In/organic Molecules' and wants to highlight that DENOPTIM is designed to handle chemical entities way beyond the strict formalisms of organic chemistry (i.e., valence rules). In fact, the development of DENOPTIM started in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ja300865u">2012</a> as a response to the need of designing transition metal complexes and organometallic catalysts that cannot even be represented unambiguously by standard chemical representations (e.g., multi-hapto metal-ligand complexes, ion pairs, highly reactive catalyst intermediates).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
How To Cite</h2>
<p >Please cite <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00516"><em>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</em> <b>2019</b>, 59, 10, 4077–4082</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Documentation</h2>
<p >You are now reading the user's manual, which provides information on how to install and use DENOPTIM. Technical documentation on the software architecture and logic is available in the <a class="el" href="md_developer_manual.html">developer's manual</a>. The latter includes also the JavaDoc and links to the source code.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Installation</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Install From Conda (recommended)</h2>
<p >DENOPTIM can be installed on using Conda package manager from the command line on Linux/MacOS. On Windows this can be done on the Anaconda prompt or by using <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git Bash</a> terminal. DENOPTIM is available on two channels: <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/denoptim">conda-forge</a>, and the channel of the <a href="https://anaconda.org/denoptim-project/denoptim">denoptim-project</a>. So, to install run either of the following commands: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">conda install -c conda-forge denoptim</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> or </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">conda install -c denoptim-project denoptim</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> You should now have the <code>denoptim</code> command available. Run the following and verify you get a help message: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">denoptim -h</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The installation from conda has been completed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Build From Source</h2>
<p >DENOPTIM can be built from source using <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.</p>
<p >First, download the <a href="https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM/releases/latest">latest release</a>. This is more than enough for regular users. However, if you are after developing the DENOPTIM code then fork the repository and work with git.</p>
<p >Extract the zip/tar.gz archive you have downloaded to generate a folder we'll call <code>DENOPTIM_HOME</code>. In the following, remember to replace <code>$DENOPTIM_HOME</code> with the pathname of the extracted DENOPTIM's distribution folder on your system.</p>
<p >Make sure you have an environment that includes JAVA and Maven. Such environment can be created by manual installation of both JAVA and Maven, or it can be created using conda: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">cd $DENOPTIM_HOME</div>
<div class="line">conda env create -f environment.yml</div>
<div class="line">conda activate dnp_devel</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Verify the requirements by running the two commands: Both should return a message declaring the respective versions. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">javac -version</div>
<div class="line">mvn -version</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Now, you can build DENOPTIM with </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">mvn package</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Once maven has finished, you can create call DENOPTIM using a command like the following (NB: replace $DENOPTIM_HOME and ${VERSION} as with the values that apply to your installation):</p>
<p >On Linux/Mac and GitBash on Windows: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">java -jar $DENOPTIM_HOME/target/denoptim-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> On Windows Anaconda prompt: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">java -jar $DENOPTIM_HOME\target\denoptim-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The installation from source has been completed.</p>

Introduction to DENOPTIM</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Representation of Chemical Entities</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Graphs</h3>
<p >DENOPTIM perceives chemical entities as graphs (outer graph in Figure 1): Graphs are collections of vertices and edges. Vertices and edges are organized in a spanning tree (T), which is acyclic by definition, and a set of fundamental cycles (Fc). The latter set defined the chords: edges that do not belong to the spanning tree and that define cycles of vertices.</p>
<div class="image">

<div class="caption">

    <h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Vertices</h3>
<p >Vertices are abstract objects: graph's building blocks that are decorated with attachment points (AP, the arrows in Figure 1). One attachment points represent the possibility to form one connection with one other vertex.</p>
<p >Vertices come in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Molecular fragment</b>: chemical building blocks containing one or more atoms and bonds. Molecular fragments define the relation between attachment point on the vertex and atoms contained in the vertex, thus allowing, if needed, to represent open valences on molecular fragments as attachment points on vertices. However, attachment points do not need to represent a given valence. The content of a molecular fragment vertex is constant.</li>
<li><b>Template</b>: vertices that embed a graph. The attachment points on a template vertex, if any, are the reflection of the attachment points of vertices belonging to the embedded graph that are not used to made connections in such embedded graph. The structure of the embedded graph's spanning tree and the identify of each vertex may be fixed, in which case the template is a container for a constant sub-graph, or may be editable allowing, for instance, to alter the embedded graph while retaining the structure defined by the template.</li>
<li><b>Empty vertices</b>: can contain properties in any form, but do not contain atoms or embedded graphs. Empty vertices are best interpreted as either property carriers or place-holding vertices.</li>
</ul>
<p >Independently on their nature, vertices are further classified according to their role as building blocks. There are three roles for vertices:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>scaffolds</b> are vertices used only to start the construction of a graph and are the only kind of vertex that can be used for this purpose. In fact, the scaffold is always the seed of the spanning trees of automatically built graphs. This role is often granted to a chemically critical building block, for example the metal center in a transition metal complex.</li>
<li><b>fragments</b> are vertices that can be used freely in the construction of a graph, but cannot be used to start a new graph. This is the regular role for most building blocks.</li>
<li><b>capping groups</b> are vertices that have only one attachment point and are used to stop the grow of a chain of vertices, typically to saturate open valences (see Capping procedure, below).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Edges</h3>
<p >Edges represent an abstract relation between vertices. An edge is the connection between two attachment points. Edges are often the reflection of chemical bonds, pseudo-bond, spatial or relational information.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Attachment Points and Attachment Point Class</h3>
<p >Attachment points are owned by vertices and represent the possibility of that specific vertex to form a connection, i.e., one edge, with one attachment point that is owned by another vertex. Attachment points can be decorated with information defining i) the atoms that hold an open valence (if any), ii) the spatial arrangement of the connected vertex in relation to the vertex holding the attachment point, and iii) a label used to classify the attachment points.</p>
<p >The latter property, the label, is a string with no spaces specifying the so-called <b>class of the attachment point</b> (or attachment point class), APClass. The APClass can be defined also by the user (e.g., via the GUI) as long as it adheres to the following syntax.</p>
<p ><code>&lt;string&gt;:&lt;int&gt;</code></p>
<p >where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>string</code> is an alphanumeric string, and</li>
<li><code>int</code> is a positive integer number.</li>
</ul>
<p >This syntax is best explain by providing an example of how molecular fragment can be generated from whole molecules. In particular, we consider our own fragmentation algorithm (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ci4007497"><em>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</em> <b>2014</b>, 54, 3, 767–780</a>), which is implemented in the program <a class="el" href="index.html#Fragmenter">Fragmenter</a>. This fragmentation algorithm uses cutting rules to identify the bond to break in order to generate fragments. For each broken bond two attachment points are generated (one on each side of the broken bond) and, in order to distinguish between the two sides of the broken bond, these attachment points are given two complementary APClasses. These APClasses share a common part (the reference to the cutting rule) and have an additional suffix that makes them distinguishable. For example, if the cutting rule is named <code>myCuttingRule</code>, the two APs will have APClass <code>myCuttingRule:0</code> and <code>myCuttingRule:1</code>.</p>
<p >Notably, APClasses are a way to encode the chemical environment of a the two sides of a bond that was broken to generate a pair of attachment points. Conversely, this encoded information on chemical environment can be exploited to control how attachment points are best combined to form vertex-vertex connections. In particular, while APClasses can be used to rebuild only the types of connections that were originally broken in the fragmentation procedure, they also allow to introduce compatibilities across different APClasses. To this end, DENOPTIM uses a so-called Compatibility Matrix (see below) to define which combinations of APClasses are to be considered as compatible when building or editing graph by attaching or replacing vertices.</p>
<p >The construction and editing of graphs is thus controlled by the APClass compatibilities and independent from valence rules. This allows to define a completely customizable set of rules for building any kind of entity, including models of disconnected systems, active species and transition states. However, in order to make sure that the entities built this way are valid chemical entities, an additional procedure in needed to saturate the free attachment points that, if left unused, would result in unwanted open valences. This procedure is called "capping" and it adds "capping groups" (see above) on specifically defined free attachment points.</p>
<p >The use of capping groups is particularly useful when standard “hydrogenation” routine (i.e., addition of H to every open valence) is expected to fail. This occurs when the chemical entities under construction are not standard organic molecules similar to those for which “hydrogenation” tools have been trained.</p>
<p >The settings of the capping procedure define the list of APClasses that need to be capped, and the APClasses of the capping groups to use for each of the APClasses that need capping. These settings are part of the Compatibility Matrix file (see below).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Symmetry</h3>
<p >DENOPTIM can repeat any graph operation on sets of APs that are related by high degree of topological similarity. APs are considered symmetric when they have</p>
<ul>
<li>same attachment point class,</li>
<li>same element as the AP’s source atom (if any),</li>
<li>same type and number of bonds connected to the source atom (if any),</li>
<li>same element and number of atoms connected to the source atom (if any).</li>
</ul>
<p >Users can control the probability of symmetric operations on specific APClasses and include symmetry constraints also based on APClasses (see keywords section, below).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="FitnessEvaluation"></a>
Evaluation of Chemical Entities: Fitness Evaluation</h2>
<p >The design of functional chemical entities depends on the capability of evaluating how candidate entities are fit for a given purpose: the evaluation of the fitness. In DENOPTIM, such evaluation aims to associate the internal representation of a chemical entity, i.e., a graph, with a numerical value, i.e., the fitness. For the sake of generality, DENOPTIM does not take any assumption as to how the fitness is calculated, but it assumes that a "fitness provider" is defined for the purpose of evaluating the fitness of each candidate.</p>
<p >Fitness providers can be of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal fitness provider: it's DENOPTIM's code that is executed within the DENOPTIM virtual machine to calculate descriptors from chemical representation that are built on-the-fly for each chemical entity from its graph representation. The descriptors are then combined into a numerical fitness value according to an equation that must be defined in the input. The internal fitness provider does not perform any molecular modeling, such as geometry optimization and the like.</li>
<li><p class="startli">external fitness provider: it's a software external to DENOPTIM, that DENOPTIM runs as a sub-process to compute the fitness of a chemical entity. Any <code>bash</code> or <code>python</code> script can be executed as an external fitness provider. An external fitness provider is expected to do the following tasks:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Read the input defining the entity to evaluate from an <a class="el" href="index.html#CandidateChemicalEntityFiles">SDF file produced by DENOPTIM</a>.</li>
<li>Perform any molecular modeling tasks, including, for example, 3D model construction, property calculations, output file parsing, and post processing.</li>
<li>Calculate the fitness value from the results of the molecular modeling tasks.</li>
<li>Create an output SDF file (see <a class="el" href="index.html#FitnessFiles">Fitness Files</a>) for storing the fitness value of the candidate entity (or a properly formatted error message) in addition to any useful output data that might be used to post-process the results.</li>
</ol>
<p class="startli">When DENOPTIM algorithms are asked to use an external fitness provider, they execute such task, wait for completion, and retrieve the final results from the <a class="el" href="index.html#FitnessFiles">output fitness file</a>. Note that DENOPTIM programs do not interact with the running script.</p>
</li>
</ul>

DENOPTIM Programs</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p >The graphical user interface (GUI) is the main interface used for preparing and inspecting DENOPTIM files and experiments. To launch the GUI, you can chose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you installed via conda (recommended), you can run the command following command. <div class="fragment"><div class="line">denoptim</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>alternatively, double click on the <code>denoptim-${PKG_VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code> file, the location of which depends on how you have installed DENOPTIM: this file will be under <code>target</code> subfolder of the DENOPTIM distribution folder (the folder downloaded to install the release) if you have built DENOPTIM from source, of it will be under the <code>${path_to_active_env_location}/lib/</code> for installation via conda.</li>
<li>another alternative is to run the following command, again the <code>${path_to_denoptim_jar}</code> depends on how you have installed DENOPTIM (see previous point): <div class="fragment"><div class="line">java -jar ${path_to_denoptim_jar}/denoptim-${PKG_VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
</ul>
<p >For installation via conda, remember to activate the appropriate conda environment before issuing any of the above command.</p>
<p >The GUI provides instruction to itself in the form of tool tip messages (hold the cursor still over a button or plot to get a short message explaining what is the functionality of that component) and question-mark-buttons ("?") that can be clicked to display more detailed instructions.</p>
<p >The GUI can be used to open files directly from the command line: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">denoptim path/to/file1 path/to/file2 path/to/file3</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The above command will open the three files if their format is recognized as one of the file formats DENOPTIM's gui can open. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDF and JSON files containing vertices, graphs or candidate entities</li>
<li>text files containing list of <a class="el" href="index.html#Keywords">Keywords and values</a> (i.e., input parameter files) and <a class="el" href="index.html#CompatibilityMatrixfile">Compatibility Matrix file</a>.</li>
<li>folders containing the results of denovo and combinatorial design (see <a class="el" href="index.html#GARunOutput">GA Output</a> and <a class="el" href="index.html#FragSpaceExplorerOutput">FragSpaceExplorer Output</a> respectively)</li>
</ul>
<p >Finally, the GUI offers also the possibility to configure and run de novo design and virtual screening experiments that can otherwise be run by background processes as explained below. The threads executing GUI-controlled experiments are fully dependent on the GUI, and will be terminated upon closure of the GUI (the user receives a warning, in such cases).</p>

Genetic Algorithm Runner</h2>
<p >De novo design driven by a genetic algorithm using graphs as genome for chemical entities. The overall schematic of the genetic algorithm (GA) is shown in Figure 3. The algorithm begins with a population of candidates that can be given as input or generated from scratch. Next, a given number of generations are created by producing new offspring either from application of the genetic operators, or by building new entities from scratch. <br  />

    <h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
Genetic Operations</h3>
<p >Genetic operations are meant to generate graph from scratch (i.e., construction operator), from one parent (i.e., mutation operator), or from a pair of parents (i.e., crossover operator). These events all have to respect the APClass compatibility rules that, together with the libraries of building blocks, define the space of graph building blocks (BB Space). In addition, for symmetric graphs, addition or removal of a vertex can be propagated across all sites related by symmetry. Notably, the vertex corresponding to the scaffold is not subject to crossover or mutation.</p>
<p >The construction operator generates candidates by taking random choices on the scaffold vertex to use as graph seed, on the AP and incoming vertices to use to grow a branch layer-by-layer. The random events are controlled by probabilities setting the likeliness of graph extension events according to graph features such the number of atoms in the corresponding chemical entity and the topological complexity (see <a class="el" href="index.html#SubstitutionProbability">Substitution Probability</a>).</p>
<p >Mutation alters only one graph according to one of the following mutation types:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>change branch</em>: removes a branch of the graph and builds a replacement.</li>
<li><em>add link</em>: inserts a vertex in between two previously-connected vertices.</li>
<li><em>change link</em>: replaces a non-terminal vertex while retaining the connectivity with downstream branches.</li>
<li><em>delete link</em>: removes a non-terminal vertex and reconnects the open ends generated by removal of the original vertex.</li>
<li><em>delete chain</em>: removes an entire branch in acyclic graphs or the part of a cyclic graph between two branching points thus opening the ring by removing the bridging chain.</li>
<li><em>extend</em>: extends a branch of the graph.</li>
<li><em>delete</em>: removes a branch starting from a vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p >The mutation operator can be configured to perform also multi-site mutations: mutation that can alter a graph more multiple times on possibly independent location and performing independent mutation types.</p>
<p >Crossover involves the swapping of one subgraph from each of the parents to the other parent. The subgraphs to swap (a.k.a. the crossover sites) need not to be terminal (i.e., crossover is not limited to dangling branches) and can be of any size, from a single vertex to an entire branch attached to the scaffold. When template vertices are present in the parent graphs, crossover sites are defined so that the subgraphs to swap belong to graphs that are at the same level of embedding in the recursive template-graph structure of the two parents. Moreover, the subgraphs can include only vertices belonging to the same level of embedding. Finally, while crossover generates two offspring from two parents, only one offspring is considered to be the product of a single crossover event.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="SubstitutionProbability"></a>
Substitution Probability</h3>
<p >The generation of very large graphs or graphs with too many incident edges on a single vertex can be reduced by tuning the so-called substitution probability: the probability of appending a vertex on to a free AP. The substitution probability (<em>P</em>) results from the product of two components: the growth probability (<em>P<sub>g</sub></em>), and the crowding probability (<em>P<sub>c</sub></em>). The growth probability (<em>P<sub>g</sub></em>) limits the growth of an entity. This limit can be expressed in terms of graph deepness (i.e., using the <em>level</em> of a vertex to determine the likeliness of further graph extension on that vertex, see Figure 4) or in terms of molecular size (i.e., number of heavy atoms, irrespectively of graph size).</p>
<div class="image">

<div class="caption">
Figure 4: identification of levels in a graph. Each label Lx identifies the shell of vertexes of level X. Red, dashed lines represent the border between levels. Yellow circles represent free APs. Squares of different color represent vertexes of different kind (scaffold, normal vertex, or capping group).</div></div>
    <p >To illustrate, vertex 1 in Figure 4 is the scaffold vertex (i.e., represented by a red square) and is in level -1 (<em>L<sub>-1</sub></em>), vertexes 2 (normal vertex represented by blue square), 3 (another normal vertex), and 5 (a capping group represented by a green square) are at level 0 (<em>L<sub>-0</sub></em>), and so on.</p>
<p >The <b>growth probability</b> can be controlled by one of the following schemes (where <em>L</em> is either the vertex <em>level</em> or the number of heavy atoms):</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>EXP_DIFF</b>: Given a growth multiplier factor <em>λ</em>, the probability of addition is given by <br  />
</p>
<p class="startli">\( \large p = \frac {1 - e^{(-L\lambda)}}{1 + e^{(-L\lambda)}}  \)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>TANH</b>: Given a growth multiplier factor <em>λ</em>, the probability of addition is determined by <br  />
</p>
<p class="startli">\( \large p = 1 - tanh(\lambda L) \)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>SIGMA</b>: This scheme is based on two factors \(σ_1\) (the steepness of the function where the probability is 50%) and \(σ_2\) (the value of <em>L</em> where the probability is 50%), and calculates the probability as <br  />
</p>
<p class="startli">\( \large p = 1 - \frac {1}{1 + e^{(-\sigma_1(L -\sigma_2)}} \)</p>
</li>
<li><b>UNRESTRICTED</b>: This scheme allows for unrestricted growth (<em>p = 1</em> at all levels).</li>
</ul>
<p >The <b>crowding probability</b> is meant to reduce the likeliness of adding incident edges to a vertex that is already using one or more APs rooted on the same source atom that holds the AP for which we are evaluating the substitution probability. Practically, for a free AP (<em>APi</em>) we define the <em>crowdedness</em> (<em>C<sub>APi</sub></em>) as the number of non-free APs that are rooted on the same source atom holding (<em>APi</em>).</p>
<p >For example, we consider vertex 3 in Figure 4 (i.e., the blue square at the center of the figure), and assume that the molecular representation of this vertex consists of a single atom holding four attachment points. To calculate the crowdedness of <em>AP2</em> (i.e., the yellow circle located below the blue square representing vertex 3) we count the number of APs that i) share the same source atom of <em>AP2</em>, and ii) are used to form edges with vertices that are not capping groups. While condition <em>i</em> is satisfied by all four APs of the vertex, only two APs satisfy condition <em>ii</em>. The crowdedness of <em>AP2</em> is thus <em>C<sub>APi</sub></em> = 2.</p>
<p >The crowding probability for <em>APi</em> is then calculated using the crowdedness <em>C<sub>APi</sub></em> according to any of the schemes presented above (<b>EXP_DIFF</b>, <b>TANH</b>, <b>SIGMA</b>, <b>UNRESTRICTED</b>) using <em>C<sub>APi</sub></em> in place of <em>L</em>.</p>

Parents Selection Strategies</h3>
<p >An important aspect of any evolutionary algorithm is that of selection of the best set of individuals (chromosomes) for the next generation. It is also essential to maintain enough diversity in the genetic material so that the solution/chemical space is sufficiently covered. In DENOPTIM the following selection strategies are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Random</b>: In this scheme, chromosomes are randomly selected.</li>
<li><b>Tournament (TS)</b>: In this scheme, a group of size n (typically 2) is randomly chosen from the current population. The fittest from the group is then added to the mating pool.</li>
<li><b>RouletteWheel (RW)</b>: In this sampling scheme, each chromosome is assigned a portion/slice of the roulette wheel, the area of the portion being proportional to its fitness. The wheel is then spun a number of times and the chromosome corresponding to the slice that comes under the wheel marker is added to the pool.</li>
<li><b>Stochastic universal sampling (SUS)</b>: differs from RW in that it uses <em>N</em> (number of selections required) equally spaced pointers. The population is shuffled randomly and a single random number <em>r</em> in the range [0, 1] is generated. The <em>N</em> individuals are then chosen by generating the <em>N</em> pointers, starting with <em>r</em> and spaced by <em>1</em>, and selecting the individuals whose fitness spans the positions of the pointers. Because the individuals are selected entirely based on their positions in the population and with only one randomly generated number, SUS has zero bias.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
GA Parallelization Schemes</h3>
<p >Two parallelization schemes based on the consumer-producer pattern have been implemented. In the following, a batch implies a set of jobs, i.e., fitness function evaluations (generally equal to the number of processors available) submitted for parallel execution. The first such scheme (SCH-1) uses a serial batch processing scheme wherein, the subsequent batches can only be submitted on completion of the previous. This implies that while some jobs may be completed sooner than others, the program will still wait for the other submitted tasks to complete before submitting another batch.</p>
<p >To remove this waiting time, the second scheme (SCH-2) enables continuous submission so that new jobs may be launched whenever free threads are available. Notably, a side effect of this scheme is that results from a long running calculation, for e.g. started in <code>Generation #1</code>, may only become available in <code>Generation #20</code>. In such cases, the evaluated molecule will become part of the population only in generation #20. The fixed generational behavior of the GA is subsequently lost.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
GA Run Input</h3>
<p >A GA run can be performed either by defining the input in the GUI and running the experiment from the gui, or by issuing this command: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">denoptim -r GA input_parameters_file</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> where <code>input_parameters_file</code> is a text file collecting the configuration parameters for the GA program. Such file can have any name and contains one input parameter per line. The <code>#</code> character is used to denote a comment, and lines starting with this character are not processed. Each input parameter is specified by means of a keyword. The complete list of keywords is available in the <a class="el" href="index.html#Keywords">Keywords</a> section. Examples of input files can be found in the test folder. Note that <code>input_parameters_file</code> file can be generated with the GUI from "New Evolutionary De Novo Design" button.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="GARunOutput"></a>
GA Run Output</h3>
<p >The program outputs a number of files during its execution. At the beginning of the execution, the program creates a directory <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS</code> and a log file <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log</code> that are named according to the date (<code>YYYYMMDD</code>) and time (<code>HHMMSS</code>). All relevant files generated by DENOPTIN associated with the current run are stored in this folder. Instead, files managed by external fitness provider script are not directly used by the GA runner code and can thus be placed anywhere. Files pertaining to a specific generation are stored in sub-folders <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS/Gen#</code> (where <code>#</code> is the generation number), while the final results of an evolutionary experiment are collected in sub-folder <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS/Final</code> (see Figure 5).</p>
<div class="image">

<div class="caption">

    <p >Once a generation is completed, the software creates a summary of the current population. For instance, the summary for generation <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> is an integer number, is available as a TXT file (<code>GenN/GenN.txt</code>).</p>

Interacting with Ongoing GA Runs</h3>
<p >During a GA run the user often desires to intervene with actions altering the course of the experiment. The GARunner runs a command listener that checks for instructions deposited in a dedicated location of the file system. Depending on the instructions found, DENOPTIM will try to perform the corresponding tasks as soon as compatible with the ongoing algorithm. Once an instruction has been found and interpreted by DENOPTIM (this event is reported in the log file), it cannot be undone/overwritten, even if it is still to be performed.</p>
<p >The user can formulate instructions in the form of properly formatted ascii files (i.e., an <em>intructions_file</em>) that are deposited under the <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS/interface</code> folder, i.e., a file-system location that is specific for a single GA run. The <em>intructions_file</em> has effects only on the specific GA run that generated the <code>RUNYYYYMMDDHHMMSS</code> folder.</p>
<p >The <em>intructions_file</em> is a text file. The name of any such file is irrelevant: any file will be read irrespectively of its name. Each <em>intructions_file</em> is red line-by-line: each line can be arbitrarily long and will be interpreted as a single instruction. Each line begins with a keyword that defines the kind of instruction. The keyword is separated from the rest of the line by a blank space. After the blank space a variable number of arguments can be given depending on the specific instruction (see below). Currently, the following instructions can be given to DENOPTIM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminate the GA experiment. Keyword: <code>STOP_GA</code>; Arguments: no further arguments required. Just type the <code>STOP_GA</code> keyword.</li>
<li>Remove one or more candidate from the current population. Keyword <code>REMOVE_CANDIDATE</code> , Arguments: space-separated list of candidate names (e.g., <code>REMOVE_CANDIDATE M00000028 M00000031</code> asks to remove both candidates from the population, if they are still in the population).</li>
<li>Evaluate one or more manually generated candidates and possibly include them into the population. Keyword <code>ADD_CANDIDATE</code>, Arguments: space-separated list of pathnames to files defining the candidate to be added (e.g., <code>ADD_CANDIDATE /tmp/candidate_1.sdf /tmp/candidate_2.sdf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
FragSpaceExplorer</h2>
<p >FragSpaceExplorer performs systematic exploration of the fragment space, or, more appropriately, of the space of graph building blocks - BB Space). The tool can be used to visit all the combination of building blocks that can be obtained from a given starting point (i.e., one or more graphs) and a defined BB Space, i.e., an ensemble of building blocks, connection rules and constraints. FragSpaceExplorer can be used for combinatorial approaches, where a number of alternative chemical entities need to be generated and evaluated, and also to enumerate entities or just to appreciate the characteristics of a designed BB Space. For instance, one may want to know how many acceptable chemical entities are encoded in a BB Space one has configured, or the amount of redundancy in such space (i.e., number of different graphs that encode the same chemical entity).</p>
<p >A set of initial graphs (from now on referred as the roots) can be given as input or built from a library of scaffolds. FragSpaceExplorer iterates over all roots and all the combinations of building blocks: vertices of any type, including molecular fragments, capping groups, if any, and the “empty fragment”, which represents the possibility of leaving the AP unused if permitted. Only one vertex is appended on each attachment point, thus each root is coated by vertices layer-by-layer. The graphs generated by adding N layers of vertices belong to the L<sub>N-1</sub> and are used as roots to create the graphs of L<sub>N</sub> (Figure 6).</p>

    <p >The exploration terminates with the exhaustion of the combinatorial space or with the completion of the maximum allowed level set by the user (see <a class="el" href="index.html#Keywords">Keywords</a>).</p>
<p >All graphs are complete (i.e., no capping groups needed, no forbidden free AP found) and acceptable (i.e., respecting all constraints imposed by the user; for instance max. number of heavy atoms, max. molecular weight, etc.) can be sent to a fitness evaluation task performed by an internal or external fitness provider. For example, the external subtask may include 3D model construction and property evaluation, or calculation of a fitness. Such fitness is recorded for each candidate, but is not used to guide the combinatorial search in any way.</p>

Restart FragSpaceExplorer from Checkpoint file</h3>
<p >FragSpaceExplorer can be very long, so a checkpoint file is dumped at regular time intervals (by default every N graphs, where N=100; see <a class="el" href="index.html#Keywords">Keywords</a> section) to keep track of where the exploration has arrived and, in case of abrupt termination of the execution, restart the FSE experiment from the checkpoint file. Calculation that were running when the termination occurred or that were submitted after the generation of the checkpoint file are considered to be lost and will be re-submitted upon restart of the FSE run. Therefore, to avoid duplicate the files related to those “lost”, calculations should be collected and isolated.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Fragmenter"></a>
Fragmenter</h2>
<p >Fragmenter is a program that performs fragmentation of molecules and management of fragments. Fragmentation is based on the application of bond-cutting rules that identify which bonds should be broken (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ci4007497"><em>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</em> <b>2014</b>, 54, 3, 767–780</a>). Each broken bond is replaced by a pair of attachment points: one attachment point on each of the atoms (or pseudoatoms) that were originally bonded. The attachment point class (APClass) on each such attachment points is defined by the string identifying the cutting rule (i.e., the rule name) and an integer that distinguish the two ends of the broken bond. For example, if the cutting rule is named <code>myCuttingRule</code>, the two APs will have APClass <code>myCuttingRule:0</code> and <code>myCuttingRule:1</code>.</p>
<p >Fragmenter can also filter fragments according to criteria based on fragment's molecular formula, number of non-Hydrogen atoms, substructures (by SMARTS), and pool of attachment points. Moreover, graph-isomorphic fragments (i.e., fragments that have the same topological structure of atoms, bonds, and attachment points, but possibly different geometry) can be collected and analyzed by Fragmenter to identify clusters of geometries and extract the most representative geometry for each cluster. Both filtration and clustering are tasks that can be performed during the fragmentation of molecules or in a standalone fashion.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="GraphIsomorphism"></a>
Graph Isomorphism Analyzer</h2>
<p >This is a program that analyzes graph aiming to detect "DENOPTIM-isomorphism". "DENOPTIM-isomorphic" is a DENOPTIM-specific definition of <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IsomorphicGraphs.html">graph isomorphism</a> that differs from the most common meaning of isomorphism in graph theory. In general, graphs are considered undirected when evaluating DENOPTIM-isomorphism. Next, since a graph is effectively a spanning tree (ST<sub>i</sub>={{vertices}, {acyclic edges}}) with a set of fundamental cycles (FC<sub>i</sub>={C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>,...C<sub>n</sub>}), any graph G={ST<sub>i</sub>,FC<sub>i</sub>} that contains one or more cycles can be represented in multiple ways, G={ST<sub>j</sub>,FC<sub>j</sub>} or G={ST<sub>k</sub>,FC<sub>k</sub>}, that differ by the position of the chord/s and by the corresponding pair of ring-closing vertices between each chord defined. The DENOPTIM-isomorphism for two graphs G1 and G2 is given by the common graph theory isomorphism between two undirected graphs U1 and U2 built respectively from G1 and G2.</p>
<p >Finally,</p>
<ul>
<li>vertices are compared excluding their vertex ID,</li>
<li>edges are considered undirected and compared considering the bond type they declare and the identity of the attachment points connected thereby. This latter point has an important implication: two apparently equal graphs (same vertices that are connected to each other forming the same vertex-chains) can be non-isomorphic when the APs used to connect two vertices are not the same. Chemically, this means the stereochemistry around one or both vertices, is different in the two graphs. Therefore two otherwise equal-looking graphs can very well be, de facto, not DENOPTIM-isomorphic.</li>
</ul>
<p >This method makes use of the Vento-Foggia VF2 algorithm (see <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1323804">DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2004.75</a>) as implemented in <a href="https://jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a>.</p>

After starting the server, files containing DENOPTIM-like data, such as, vertexes, graphs, and molecular representations, can be read in Python to produce Python objects that offer most of the functionality used within DENOPTIM. <br  />

Vertices</h2>
<p >Vertices can be defined in files with two different formats: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#SDF">SDF</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.</p>
<p >SDF file format are best suited for vertices that contain molecular fragments because they can be opened by most molecular visualization packages. Still, SDF format can be used with any type of vertex.</p>
<p >The requirement for the chemical representation contained in an SDF file to be perceived as a vertex is the presence of associated data (also called tags, fields, or properties) that define the attachment points, i.e., the <code>&lt;ATTACHMENT_POINT&gt;</code> property. The value of this property must reflect the following syntax convention. For a single attachment point, which we'll call attachment point <em>A</em> (square brackets indicate optional components):</p>
<p ><code>N_1#CL_A:SC_A<code></code>[<code></code>:BT_A<code></code>]<code></code>[<code></code>:X_A%Y_A%Z_A<code></code>]</code> </p>
<p >For multiple attachment points, which we'll refer to as attachment points <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, that are rooted on the same atom (square brackets indicate optional components):</p>
<p ><code>N_2#CL_B:SC_B<code></code>[<code></code>:BT_B<code></code>]<code></code>[<code></code>:X_B%Y_B%Z_B<code></code>]<code></code>,CL_C:SC_C<code></code>[<code></code>:BT_C<code></code>]<code></code>[<code></code>:X_C%Y_C%Z_C<code></code>]</code> </p>
<p >where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>N_1</code> is the 1-based index of the atom/pseudo-atom on which attachment point <em>A</em> is rooted, while <code>N_2</code> is the 1-based index of the atom/pseudo-atom on which both attachment point <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are rooted.</li>
<li><code>CL_i</code> is the first part (i.e., the string called "rule") of the APClass of attachment point <em>i</em>.</li>
<li><code>SC_i</code> is the second part (i.e., the integer called "subclass") of the APClass of attachment point <em>i</em>.</li>
<li><code>BT_i</code> defines the bond type of the APClass of attachment point <em>i</em>. Possible values are <code>NONE</code>, <code>SINGLE</code>, <code>DOUBLE</code>, <code>TRIPLE</code>, <code>QUADRUPLE</code>, <code>ANY</code>, and <code>UNDEFINED</code>.</li>
<li><code>X_i</code> and <code>Y_i</code> and <code>Z_i</code> are the Cartesian coordinates defining the "AP vector". For APs rooted on atoms (the source atoms) the AP vector defines the ideal position where the atom that can be connected with the source atom should be placed upon formation of the bond.</li>
</ul>
<p >In the SDF file, each string pertaining to a single source atom is separated by a single space from the next string. So, the overall result is the following:</p>
<p ><span style="display: inline-block; color: black; background-color: #F0F8FF;"> … <br  />
 &gt; &lt;ATTACHMENT_POINTS&gt; <br  />
 <code>N_1#CL_A:SC_A<code></code>:BT_A<code></code>:X_A%Y_A%Z_A&#160;N_2#CL_B:SC_B<code></code>:BT_B<code></code>:X_B%Y_B%Z_B<code></code>,CL_C:SC_C<code></code>:BT_C<code></code>:X_C%Y_C%Z_C</code> <br  />
 … <br  />
</span></p>
<p ><span style="display: inline-block; color: black; background-color: #F0F8FF;"></span></p>
<p >Considering the optional components, the following alternatives are also recognized and used for APs that do not define bond types (NB: they accept the default bond type, i.e., <code>SINGLE</code>) and/or AP vectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="display: inline-block; color: black; background-color: #F0F8FF;"><code>N_1#CL_A:SC_A<code></code>:BT_A</code> </span></li>
<li><span style="display: inline-block; color: black; background-color: #F0F8FF;"><code>N_1#CL_A:SC_A<code></code>:X_A%Y_A%Z_A</code> </span></li>
<li><span style="display: inline-block; color: black; background-color: #F0F8FF;"><code>N_1#CL_A:SC_A</code> </span></li>
</ul>
<p >Additional fields can be present in SDF files saved by DENOPTIM. In particular, DENOPTIM new version always saves the JSON format as one of the properties of the SDF file format.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="CuttingRules"></a>
Cutting rules file</h2>
<p >The file defining cutting rules is a text file with keyword-labelled lines. Each line starting with the <code>CTR</code> keyword defines the specifics for a single cutting rule according to the following syntax:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">CTR rulename priority 1st_atm_SMARTS 2nd_atm_SMARTS bnd_SMARTS [options]</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rulename</code> is a single word defining the name of the cutting rule. The class of attachment points generated by the action of the cutting rule derives from this rule name.</li>
<li><code>priority</code> is an integer (with sign) that is used to specify the priority order for the application of cutting rules. The priority follows ascending order.</li>
<li><code>1st_atm_SMARTS</code> is an atom SMARTS query matching one of the atoms involved in the bond.</li>
<li><code>2nd_atm_SMARTS</code> is an atom SMARTS query matching one of the atoms involved in the bond.</li>
<li><code>bnd_SMARTS</code> is a bond component of the SMARTS query matching the bond between the atoms identified above. The complete bond SMARTS is built by merging the three components in the order <code>1st_atm_SMARTS + bnd_SMARTS + 2nd_atm_SMARTS</code></li>
<li><code>options</code> is an optional list of settings that apply to the cutting rule. For a candidate bond to be considered a true match, all optional conditions must be satisfied simultaneously (i.e., logical AND).<ul>
<li><code>HAPTO</code> specifies that the bond matched by the cutting rule has to be part of multihapto system. Use of this option is not compatible with RING and OMRING options.</li>
<li><code>RING&gt;n</code> (where <code>n</code> is an integer) specifies that the target bond, if part of an organic ring (i.e., not containing any metal atoms), is considered a true match only if the number of ring members is greater than <code>n</code>.</li>
<li><code>OMRING&gt;n</code> (where <code>n</code> is an integer) works like <code>RING&gt;n</code> but is restricted to rings involving one or more metals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p >Here is an example of the content of a cutting rule file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">…</div>
<div class="line">CTR sArAlkM 2 [$(C([#1])(C)C)] [$(cCC)] -!@  </div>
<div class="line">CTR MAlkene -1 [Pt] [$([#6;X4]1~[#6;X4][Pt]1)] - HAPTO</div>
<div class="line">…</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >A file with a complete set of cutting rules is available under <code>src/main/resources/data/</code> in the distribution folder.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="FormulaFile"></a>
Formula file</h2>
<p >The file collecting molecular formulae for chemical structures provided in an associated SDF file is a text file with keyword-labelled lines. Each entry, i.e., each structure, is associated with a group of lines starting with the keyword <code>REFCODE</code>. The group of line must contain the keyword <code>Formula</code> which identifies the line containing the actual molecular formula. The molecular formula can include multiple molecules, and variable stoichiometric factors. Example of valid formulae are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C6 H12 O6</code></li>
<li><code>(C18 V2 H16)n,2n(H2 O1),Cl 1-</code></li>
<li><code>(C44 H32 Fe2 N24 Pd2)n,6(H2 O1)</code></li>
<li><code>C19 H27 N2 O9 Zn2 1+,C1 N1 S1 1-</code></li>
<li><code>C9 H24 P2 2+,2(C1 F3 O3 S1 1-)</code></li>
</ul>
<p >Here is an example of the content of a formula file containing the molecular formula for multiple structure. Each structure is identified by the <code>REFCODE</code> identifier.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">…</div>
<div class="line">REFCODE: ABCDEF</div>

</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="CompatibilityMatrixfile"></a>
Compatibility Matrix file</h2>
<p >The compatibility matrix file is a text file that includes blocks of information related to the APClass compatibility rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>the definition of the actual AP class compatibility matrix (lines starting with <code>RCN</code> keyword, comma-separated entries),</li>
<li>the rules to append capping groups (<code>CAP</code> keyword),</li>
<li>the rules to discharge a graph if an AP of a specific APClass is not used (<code>DEL</code> keyword).</li>
</ul>
<p >Example of a compatibility matrix file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"># Comment line</div>
<div class="line">RCN apclass1:0 apclass1:1,apclass2:0,apclass2:1</div>

<div class="line">RCN apclass2:0 apclass2:1</div>
<div class="line"># Note that any class name not found in the library of fragments can be used to impose that no fragment (excluding</div>
<div class="line"># capping groups) is attached on APs of a specific class.</div>
<div class="line"># In this example, no fragment will be attached to APs of class apclass2:1</div>
<div class="line">RCN apclass2:1 none</div>

</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md41"></a>
Ring Closures Compatibility Matrix file</h2>
<p >The ring closures (RC) compatibility matrix file specifies the pairs of AP classes that are allowed to form ring-closing bonds. Note that, contrary to the standard compatibility matrix, the RC compatibility matrix is symmetric. The syntax is the same as for a general-purpose compatibility matrix.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"># Comment line</div>

</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md42"></a>
Initial Population File</h2>
<p >SDF format is used to provide an initial set of fully characterized candidates (i.e., initial population). To be properly interpreted by DENOPTIM this SDF file must include the following tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;FITNESS&gt;</code> tag specifying the numerical fitness value.</li>
<li><code>&lt;UID&gt;</code> tag specifying the unique identifier of the chemical entity (often the InChiKey).</li>
<li><code>&lt;GraphJson&gt;</code> tag specifying the essential part of the graph representation of the chemical entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="CandidateChemicalEntityFiles"></a>
Candidate Chemical Entity Files</h2>
<p >SDF format file used to communicate the definition of a candidate entity to external fitness providers (see <a class="el" href="index.html#FitnessEvaluation">Fitness evaluation</a>).</p>
<p >DENOPTIM programs output a non-optimized 3D-structure of the chemical entity in SDF format together with its graph representation (tag <code>&lt;GraphJson&gt;</code>) and additional information (i.e., SMILES, InChiKey, unique identifier). By default, the Cartesian coordinates reported in these files are those of a three-dimensional tree-like model built by aligning each building block according to the attachment point vectors. The resulting geometry is not refined, and is only meant to facilitate further processing and visual inspection. While such geometry can be used as starting point for further molecular modeling, it should never be used to calculate any property dependent on the molecular geometry. The alignment of the building blocks is skipped when using the <code>FP-No3dTreeModel</code> keyword. In this case, the SDF file will contain Cartesian coordinates of the initial building blocks, and will therefore be characterized by a correct topology but a non-sense arrangement of the atoms.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="FitnessFiles"></a>
Fitness Files</h2>
<p >SDF format files used to store the final results for an evaluated chemical entity and to receive the fitness value from any external fitness provider. These files must contain one of these two tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;MOL_ERROR&gt;</code> tag specifying that the candidate entity cannot be coupled with a fitness value. The content of this field is used to report details on the reasons leading to this result. The following syntax must be used: <br  />
 <div class="fragment"><div class="line">…</div>
<div class="line">&gt; &lt;Mol_ERROR&gt;</div>
<div class="line">#Keyword identifying error1: details characterizing the error1</div>
<div class="line">#Keyword identifying error2: details characterizing the error2</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">…</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li><code>&lt;FITNESS&gt;</code> tag specifying the numerical value of the fitness (NB: ensure is not NaN!)</li>
</ul>
<p >Additional tag defining an unique identifier of the entity (i.e., <code>&gt; &lt;UID&gt;</code>) is also needed.</p>
<p >Any type and number of descriptors and properties can be included in the SDF file using the '<code>&gt; &lt;DATA&gt;</code>' syntax, where <code>DATA</code> is replaced by the name of a specific data tag. The number and kind of descriptors depends on the specific application.</p>
<p >Example of a fitness file with properly terminated calculation of the fitness value:</p>
