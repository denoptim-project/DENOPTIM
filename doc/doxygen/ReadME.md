Doxygen Documentation                  
======================

DENOPTIM's Documentation is built with Doxygen.
See [here](https://doxygen.nl/index.html) for more information about Doxygen and its use.

This directory contains all the documents used to construct the documentation and
the Doxyfile and DoxygenLayout files are the one used to manage doxygen input, ouput and relationships.

In case some modifications occur in the the new documentation is build by executing the command

  doxygen

in this directory. The new, modified documentation will be visible in the file index.html under the
directory html

To learn how to use DENOPTIM for running experiments and simulations click on the User's Manual.  

[User's Manual](user_manual.md)    

If instead you want to learn about DENOPTIM software architecture and its logic click on the Developer's Manual

[Developer's Manual](developer_manual.md)

The two manuals are extensively interlinked to aid better comprehension.
